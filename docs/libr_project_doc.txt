LIBR
A Moderated, Censorship-Resilient Social Network Framework
LIBR is a protocol for building digital public forums and social networks that are
both provably censorship-resilient and safeguarded against harmful or
illegal content.
Traditional centralized platforms (Facebook, Reddit, Twitter, etc.) control their
own databases, which lets them remove or block content at will—undermining
free expression. Fully decentralized networks avoid that single point of control,
but without any moderation they may become overrun by offensive or malicious
posts, turning communities chaotic rather than constructive.
LIBR strikes a balance by using a replicated DHT (Distributed Hash Table)
setting for partial immutability—cheaper and faster than storing every message
on a full blockchain—while storing necessary global configuration on a public
Blockchain (eg., Ethereum). At the same time, content, for each community, is
vetted (or approved) by a decentralized moderation quorum (a majority of
moderators), so that no single moderator can decide the fate of a message. Only
when a majority of moderators approve does a message get stored and shared,
keeping the forum both open and safe.​
​
The LIBR protocol is currently implemented as a working prototype, with core
components—clients, database nodes, and moderators—communicating over a
custom decentralized protocol. The system simulates blockchain-backed global
state resolution, and the full implementation can be found here:

Development Plan under Devlup Labs Summer of
Code
As part of SoC, the LIBR project will evolve from a working prototype into a
complete, end-to-end platform, deployable and usable in the real world. The
following milestones are planned:
-​ Blockchain Integration: Integrate a real blockchain (likely Ethereum) to
manage the global state and consensus for communities.
-​ Web Client: Build a fully functional, user-facing web application using
React.
-​ Mobile Client: Develop a mobile client using either React Native or Flutter,
to allow broader and more accessible participation.
-​ Governance Model: Design and implement a modular, transparent
governance system for node behavior, moderator onboarding, and
parameter updates.
-​ Core Optimization: Improve the underlying protocol for scalability,
modularity, and performance.
-​ Agile Lifecycle: We’ll follow a startup-style agile lifecycle to ensure rapid
iteration, feedback incorporation, and adaptability to challenges during
development.
-​ Software Testing and Metrics: We’ll be implementing robust software
testing and track key metrics such as performance, fault tolerance, and
usability to continuously refine the system.
